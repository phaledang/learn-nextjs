## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Form Handling in Next.js

Next.js 14 introduces Server Actions for form handling without API routes.

**Approaches:**
1. **Server Actions**: Server-side form handling
2. **Client-side**: Traditional form handling with fetch
3. **React Hook Form**: Popular form library
4. **Zod**: Schema validation library

### Form Validation

- **Client-side**: Immediate feedback, better UX
- **Server-side**: Security, data integrity
- **Schema validation**: Type-safe validation with Zod

## 📚 What You'll Build

1. Contact form with validation
2. User registration form
3. File upload form
4. Multi-step form
5. Form with Server Actions
