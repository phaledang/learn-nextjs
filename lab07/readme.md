# Lab 07: API Routes & Backend

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Create API routes in Next.js
- Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement middleware for API routes
- Handle request and response data
- Implement error handling
- Add CORS configuration
- Secure API endpoints
- Connect to external services

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 01-06
- Understanding of REST APIs
- Basic HTTP methods knowledge

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### API Routes in Next.js

API Routes provide a solution to build your API with Next.js.

**Features:**
- File-based API routing
- Built-in request/response handling
- Middleware support
- Environment variables
- Edge Runtime support

### Route Handlers

In the App Router, Route Handlers are defined in `route.ts` files:

```
app/api/
├── users/
│   └── route.ts       # /api/users
└── posts/
    ├── route.ts       # /api/posts
    └── [id]/
        └── route.ts   # /api/posts/[id]
```

## 📚 What You'll Build

In this lab, you'll create:
1. RESTful API endpoints
2. CRUD operations
3. API middleware
4. Error handling
5. Authentication for API routes
6. Rate limiting

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

2-3 hours
