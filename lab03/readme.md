### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS.

**Benefits:**
- Rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Small production bundle (with purging)
- Responsive design made easy
- Dark mode support

### Utility-First Approach

Instead of writing custom CSS classes, you compose designs using utility classes:

```html
<!-- Traditional CSS -->
<div class="card">...</div>

<!-- Tailwind CSS -->
<div class="rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 bg-white">...</div>
```
