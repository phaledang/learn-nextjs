# Lab 05: NextAuth Authentication

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Set up NextAuth.js in Next.js
- Implement multiple authentication providers (Google, GitHub, Credentials)
- Protect routes and API endpoints
- Manage user sessions
- Create login/logout functionality
- Implement role-based access control
- Store user data securely

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 01-04
- Understanding of authentication concepts
- OAuth provider accounts (Google, GitHub)

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### NextAuth.js

NextAuth.js is a complete authentication solution for Next.js applications.

**Features:**
- Multiple authentication providers
- Secure session management
- Built-in JWT support
- Database session storage
- Email/password authentication
- Social login (Google, GitHub, etc.)

### Authentication Flow

1. User initiates sign-in
2. NextAuth handles provider communication
3. Session is created and stored
4. Protected routes check session
5. User can access authenticated content

## 📚 What You'll Build

In this lab, you'll create:
1. NextAuth configuration
2. Login/logout pages
3. Protected dashboard
4. User profile page
5. Session management
6. Middleware for route protection
